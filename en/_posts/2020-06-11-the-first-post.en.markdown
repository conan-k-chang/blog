Developer should have a blog
---
Everyone say that developer should have a blog, for a ton of reasons, such as record what you learn, train your writing/explaining skill, a place where to show others who you are... Seem that the only bad thing is that it take time. 

I totally agree

 - After working for almost two and half years, I realize that I have learned so much but forgot very quickly. In addtion to the frequently used technology, the most memorable thing is my sharing in the study group. Seem that somehow if I write down what I have learned can make me learn better.

 - Explanation practice . I recently become a mentor of a junior developer, he often misunderstands what I told him. The first idea coming is that maybe his did not have enough background knowledge. But, how about me? I should able to explain the same thing clear to anyone. It is absolutely the time to improve my explaining skill.

 - At the beginning of this year, I start looking for a new job. It means I have to show the best part of me as much as I can within a single A4 paper. At that moment, I really hope there is a file or anything that recorded what I have done. So that I can renew my resume easily.

So
